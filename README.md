# How to host your resume on GitHub Pages


Github is a repository hosting service for software development deployed through Git which is a version control system. With GitHub, we can host portfolios/blogs, projects or websites directly from a repository on gitHub.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
Essentially, our mission here is to host a resume on a GitHub page. Further down below, are step by step guidelines on how to accomplish the this task.

## Audience

* ### Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them.
Some of items we will need to achieve hosting a resume on a GitHub page is listed as follows:  

  * A Resume *written in markdown*
  * Text Editor (*In this case, we will be using* Atom)
  * Github account
 > * Sign into your gitHub account here ... using your gitHub account details.  
 * If you do **NOT** have an account, you could create an account by signing up here[link]

 * GitHub repository

> 2. Enter your desired repository name in the provided text-box for the repository name preferably short and memorable.  ![repName](repName.png)  
> 3. This is optional, but you could type in a description of the repository like "Host a resume" ![image_2](image_3.png)

> 6. Finally, click on the button **Create repository**.
>There you have it, you have successfully created a repository.




* ### Installing
Here, our text editor of interest is Atom. Thus we need to ensure we have the required IDE(*Integrated Development Environment*). If you do have Atom IDE, you will need to install it.
> To install the Atom IDE, visit: [https://flight-manual.atom.io/getting-started/sections/installing-atom/](https://flight-manual.atom.io/getting-started/sections/installing-atom/).  

  We also will be formatting our resume using Jekyll themes. If you do not have the latest version of Jekyll and ruby, then you will need to install these using terminal.
> To install Ruby and then Jekyll, visit:


## Deployment

Now that we have all that we need to begin, Ensure that the resume file we are editing is written via markdown and has the filename extension  ""**.md**""
* Given that we have created a repository, we are going to connect atom with GitHub and to do this we will first
> 1. Select the **Clone or download** drop-down menu and click on the clipboard button  ![image_7](http://github.com/guveren/Assignment2/raw/master/images/image_7.png)
